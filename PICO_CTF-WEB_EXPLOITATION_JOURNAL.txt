PICO_CTF-CHALLENGES_JOURNAL_WALKTHROUGH_4_RFERENCES
WEB-EXPLOITATION
1. GET aHEAD - We used BurpSuite to Intercept the websites GET request. Which we were able to change the GET request to HEAD value, But we had to enable the option to 'Intercept Server Responses'
ORIGINAL VALUE = 
GET /index.php? HTTP/1.1

Host: mercury.picoctf.net:53554

CHANGED VALUE = 
HEAD /index.php? HTTP/1.1

Host: mercury.picoctf.net:53554

WHAT I LEARNED: You can intercept the web traffic using BurpSuite and change the requests to whichever value you find suitable in order to acquire other sections of the web pages.

2. Cookies - This tested us on the ability to change the cookies value in order to find the flag on the stored cookies session. 

WHAT I LEARNED : I learned that the ability to modify the cookies value on the web browser gave the person the ability to access other options of the websites.

3. Insp3ct0r - We inspected the HTML, CSS and JS code base of the websites in order to acquire the flag.

WHAT I LEARNED : You can be able to change learn alot about websites by just inspecting elements of a web page.

4. Scavenger Hunt - We still were able to find clues about other sections of a web page from inspecting the HTML, CSS and JS code base of the websites. But other clues included = 

APACHE SERVER - if you navigate to the .htaccess directory of the websites. YOu can still access other section of the page.

MAC WEBSITES INFO - I also learned that navigating to the .DS_Store of the website that reveal more information of a web application. But more importantly on MAC enabled websites.
